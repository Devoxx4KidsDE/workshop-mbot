The final mbot-holder 3d object model is an assembly of two models that were found at thingiverse. So the main kudos and thanks go to both modelers:

1) Andrew Weller @ https://www.thingiverse.com/Wowellerz/about for the
Mbot bumper set : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2170447

2) Alexander Nischelwitzer @ https://www.thingiverse.com/nischi/about
mbot Pen Holder : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1999423

Thanks for your contribution as I never could have done that without your prework, guys!
