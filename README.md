# Workshop for mBot

This workshop was put together by Simon Rininsland and Stefan Höhn

We chose the mBot as a robot for the devoxx4Kids because it provides a lot of actors and sensors while being a small robot that is still at a price that would be affordable for parents whose kids fell in love with the robot after the workshop. Programming it is easy as it uses a Scratch-based GUI that allows quick learning for kids. Finally mBot looks cute and is fun to work with.

The workshop only consists of the presentation. Currently only the German version is available but we will soon provide the english one.

The workshop was created to be finished within roughly 80-90 minutes.


## Workshop handout for the Kids
The idea of the workshop is based on giving "cards" to the kids with which they can go forward step by step while being supported by their mentors. You will see that the workshop is a lot of fun.

## Instructions

**Preparation**: 
* You should print out the slides. Cut the pages with the cards into half and we recommend punching a hole and bind them with a strap or a thread (the luxury version would be to laminate the cards and staple them).
* Do a thorough training with the mentors. Our experience is that it takes something around 3 to 4 hours and be warned: the mentors quickly get pretty creative ;-)
* Make sure you follow the course as it is for the first time. We have carefully build up the course the way it is. It increases by difficulty and tries to up more and more by building on top what was learned before. Try to refrain from adding pieces of you don't have experience yet
* One of the most tricky things is connecting to the mBot. Bluetooth sometimes is tricky. Here are some hints:
** Only couple one PC with one mBot. This prevents confusion when choosing the "right" mBot for your personal setup.
** You need to couple the PC first to the mBot bluetooth, only then search for it within mBlock.
** Sometimes USB connection does not work, check in PC settings if driver is install correctly. If not, try a different USB port which need not have a "wrong" driver applied and then choses the newest one.
** Train the mentors on how to solve those issues.
** Note down the mac addresses of the mBot and place a sticky paper underneath the each mBot with the mac address. That helps you to know which mBot is which in case of confusion
